/*
 * This is a simple drinking game. Juoma means "a drink" in Finnish.
 * Rules are simple:
 *   - List players
 *   - List available drinks
 *   - The person with the highest number has to drink the drink provided by the game,
 *       player can decide portion size
 *   - If you puke or pass out, you lose
 *   - If a drink runs out, it must be removed from the drink list
 *   - Last one who's not thrown up or passed out, IS THE WINNER!
 *   - Do not die
 *   - Have fun
